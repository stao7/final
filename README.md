# Fish Eat Fish
**I will be generating a 2D sea and there are many fish, and the
player can eat the fish and stuff that are “smaller” than itself. The larger object will be
attracted by the player because it will be seen as food. While eating, the player will grow
bigger and bigger. When the fish that control by the player is moving, the water flow will
follow.
